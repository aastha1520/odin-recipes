Project: Recipes

Introduction

This project is a simple html website that contains a main index page with links to a few recipes pages. The purpose of this project is to practice and reinforce basic skills. The website has no design since it is made in only HTML. 


Skills Demonstrated

1. HTML Elements & Tags: Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document and the different types of elements used to build it.
2. HTML Boilerplate: Setting up the basic structure of an HTML document with proper elements like <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body>.
3. Working with text: Structuring text using headings, paragraphs, and other inline elements.
4. Lists: Using ordered and unordered lists to organize content.
5. Links and Images: Creating hyperlinks to navigate between pages or external websites and embedding images within a webpage.
6. Commit messages: Practicing the use of meaningful commit messages to track progress and changes in my project.


Project Purpose

This project is a part of my HTML learning journey and aims to solidify my understanding of how to structure web pages using HTML. Although the website's appearance is basic, the focus is on building a strong foundation in html before moving on to advanced topics.
